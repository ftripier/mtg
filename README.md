# Hey what's up dude

Oh you wanna use this module??? Pretty weird dude! Haha okay you little freak, here's how:

## Hitting "beats"

A script to analyze commander decks' mana curves. For a given amount of lands, figure out by which turn you'll have drawn enough lands and/or mana ramp to swing a certain amount of mana. Useful for understanding if your deck has enough lands to hit certain "beats".

Gives you the stdDev, mean, median, max, and min of the amount of turns it takes to draw a certain amount of lands.

If you specify a target turn, it'll also give you the percentage of the time you reached your target mana level on the target turn.

Run `./hitBeats.js -h` to see how to run it.
